          Deep in the the middle of “Fuji no jukai” lies a pack of 8.216 Shiba
          Inus, waiting and preparing for the war – World War 0! They represent
          confidence, strength and hate being underestimated because of their
          "cute" appearance. A well-intentioned advice: better not mess with
          them, because no Shiba comes alone! We formed a ShibArmy to declare
          war on another zero and create wealth, because we believe in{" "}
          <span className="shib">$SHIB!</span> Tighten your belt, we will soon
          reach the moon! Every Shiba Warrior is unique, with different armors,
          weapons, properties, backgrounds and much more. They are divided into
          three categories: uncommon, rare and legendary. All legendary Shiba
          gods are special, hand-drawn, one-of-a-kind masterpieces with unique
          accessories. You won't believe it until you see them!
