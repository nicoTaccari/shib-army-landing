      "<span className=highlight>Immutable X</span> positions itself as the first <span className=highlight>layer-two</span> scaling solution for <span className=highlight>NFTs</span> on <span className=highlight>Ethereum</span>. According to Immutable X, its blockchain does away with Ethereum’s limitations like low scalability, a poor user experience, illiquidity, and a slow developer experience. Instead, users benefit from instant trading and massive scalability while enjoying zero gas fees for minting and trading NFTs without compromising user or asset security. To achieve that, Immutable X is built with STARK <span className=highlight>zk-rollups</span>, a technology that Vitalik Buterin considers Ethereum to be “all-in on.” Thanks to this technology, users will be able to create and distribute assets like <span className=highlight>ERC-20</span> and <span className=highlight>ERC-721</span> tokens on a massive scale. Chris Clay, the game Ddrector of Gods Unchained, a project already building on Immutable X, stated that Immutable X allows Gods Unchained to implement a new meta-system that was previously impossible. In this fashion, Immutable X aims to create a world-class experience for users and developers alike.",

    title: "Why IMX for this project?",
    content:
      "<span className=highlight>ShibArmy NFT</span> is a project for passive income and will provide a <span className=highlight>P2E/B</span> (Play to Earn/Burn) Game in the future. Due to that a low cost network with fast transactions is necessary. A lot of other projects are using networks like SOLANA or MATIC for the same reason. We believe that ETH will be a main coin still in the future so we decided to use IMX as a low fee and fast network as our target network. Due to IMX <span className=highlight>no transaction fees for collection trading is needed</span>, the passive income will increase because there are no transaction fees and the game will be fast with the fast network. IMX is still a hidden gem and we are here to be one of the <span className=highlight>early adopters</span> with our project.",
